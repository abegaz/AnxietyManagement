# Feedback for assignment 1
All of you functional requirements (FRs) are described very well. 
However, your NFRs (non- functional requirements) are vague. 
The non-functional requirements describe how the system must 
or must not work to satisfy some quality requirements or constraints. 
It should be measureable. For instance, reliability could be represented with response time. 
You could say the response time for a certain process should not exceed 5 seconds.
Please rework on your NFRs before you start working on user stories.
